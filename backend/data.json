      "Introduction": "The passenger can book ticket through the mobile app. On booking of ticket, he/she will get Booking ID along with other ticket details. The booking details will also be available in booking history. The booking ID will also be conveyed through an SMS.The passenger can book ticket from anywhere. On successful booking of ticket, the passenger will get Booking ID along with other ticket details as SMS/Notification. The passenger should go to the source station and take print out from the ATVM, CoTVM, OCR machines using the booking ID. The passenger caan also approach UTS booking counter to take ticket printout.",
      "Scope_Of_Work": "Indian Railways did not have any structured mechanism for resolvingdelays on the part of CRIS in acquisition of hardware and peripheral equipments. The decision of Indian Railways to procure dot matrix printers for initial phases of implementation of UTS at differentlocations despite knowing its vulnerability to manipulation rendered the system prone to misuse and frauds.",
      "Future_Enhancements": "This paper addresses the critical need to extend access to the Indian Railway's Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) app to leading travel tech companies. Inter alia,it also highlights the positive impact of the IRCTCâ€™s decision to extend the reserved ticketing system booking to such companies and emphasises the potential benefits in terms of customer ease, revenue contribution, and platform optimisation."
